# How to create a make file:
// mainProgram.cpp is the one that contains the main function.
// program.cpp is the one that contains the implementation file i.e one that contains the member functions.
// program.h is the one that contains the class declaration.

mainProgram.exe: mainProgram.o program.o 
    g++ mainProgram.o program.o -o mainProgram.exe

mainProgram.o: mainProgram.cpp  // to compile the main program file
    g++ -c mainProgram.cpp

program.o: program.cpp program.h // to compile the implementation file(one that contains the member functions).
    g++ -c program.cpp

clean:
    rm *.o mainProgram.exe // to remove .o files and the executable file 
    // to remove TYPE `make clean`
