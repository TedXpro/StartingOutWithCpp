# Tic Tac Toe Game
## Introduction
This is a Tic Tac Toe game I developed when I was studying Arrays from a book called `Starting Out With C++ From Control Structures Through Objects` by `Tony Gaddis`.   
### Rules :
1. There will be two players.
2. Each player will wait turns to play.
3. No player can play in the same position that was taken before.
4. You can not place 'X' and 'O' beyond the given rows and columns.
5. Winner chosen if player places same figures in a row, column or diagonally.
6. Draw is made if there is no winner(i.e if no figure is placed in a row, column or diagonally).
